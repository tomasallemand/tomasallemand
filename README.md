# Tomás Allemand — Data Analytics & Public Policy

I work as a data analyst focused on building practical solutions for decision-making, mainly in public sector environments.

My background is in Political Science, with a strong emphasis on quantitative methods, statistics and applied data analysis. In my current role, I work primarily with SQL (Athena) to model datasets, build indicators, and support different government areas in addressing concrete operational and policy-related problems. The work is usually driven by specific pain points rather than generic reporting needs.

Alongside SQL, I use Python for data analysis, workflow automation, API integrations, and applied machine learning. Most projects combine exploratory analysis with structured modeling, always with the goal of producing outputs that can actually be used by non-technical teams

I’m interested in freelance and remote roles where data is treated as a tool for action, not just as a descriptive exercise.

## What you’ll find here
This GitHub contains a small number of projects, intentionally curated:

Each repository is structured as a case study and usually includes:
- the original problem or question
- the data and assumptions involved
- the analytical or modeling approach
- results and limitations
- clear instructions to reproduce the work

The focus is on clarity, robustness, and decision relevance, rather than on showcasing isolated technical tricks

## Areas of work
My work typically covers:
- data analysis and data modeling (SQL, Python)
- exploratory and descriptive analysis (distributions, trends, outliers)
- statistical validation and hypothesis testing when relevant
- multivariate analysis and correlation analysis
- data validation and quality checks
- indicator and KPI design
- automation of repetitive or manual processes
- applied machine learning for classification or prediction tasks
- analytical outputs aimed at decision-makers

## Tools
I regularly work with
- SQL (Mainly Athena / Presto-style engines)
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter notebooks
- Power BI
- Git and GitHub for versioned, reproducible workflows

## Background
I hold a degree in Political Science and have worked across public sector analytics, social policy projects, innovation initiatives, and applied research. This background shapes how I approach data problems: with attention to institutional constraints, incentives, and the practical limits of implementation.
